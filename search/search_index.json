Can you construct a disconnected graph \\(G\\) of two or more vertices such that \\(\\overline{G}\\) is also disconnected. Give a proof supporting your answer. Answer: No. Let us prove given a graph \\(G\\) of two or more vertices, either \\(G\\) or \\(\\overline{G}\\) is connected. \\(G\\) is disconnected. We want to show that \\(\\overline{G}\\) is connected. Suppose \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) are vertices. If \\((v, w)\\) is not an edge in \\(G\\) , then it is an edge in \\(\\overline{G}\\) , and so we have a path from \\(v\\) to \\(w\\) in \\(\\overline{G}\\) . On the other hand, if \\((v, w)\\) is an edge in \\(G\\) , then this means \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) are in the same component of \\(G\\) . Since \\(G\\) is disconnected, we can find a vertex \\(u\\) in a different component, so that neither \\((v, u)\\) nor \\((u, w)\\) are edges of \\(G\\) . Then \\((v, u, w)\\) is a path from \\(v\\) to \\(w\\) in \\(\\overline{G}\\) . This shows that any two vertices in \\(\\overline{G}\\) have a path (in fact a path of length one or two) between them in \\(\\overline{G}\\) , so \\(\\overline{G}\\) is connected.

What is the necessary and sufficient condition for \\(K_{m,n}\\) to be a regular graph? Answer: In the complete bipartite graph \\(K_{m,n}\\) , the vertices have degree \\(m\\) or degree \\(n\\) (and both of these degrees are reached). Thus, to be regular, a sufficient and necessary condition is \\(n=m\\) . [ 6 ] 6. Is there a simple graph of \\(n\\) vertices such that the vertices all have distinct degrees? Give a proof supporting your answer. Answer: If \\(n=1\\) , yes, trivial. For \\(n>1\\) . Suppose such a graph exists. Each vertex in the graph can have a degree from \\(0\\) to \\(n-1\\) (simple graphs do not forbid a degree- \\(0\\) vertex, \\emph{connected} graphs do). Since this range spans \\(n\\) values in total and each vertex degree is different, the degrees are distributed one-per-vertex. In particular, there must exist a vertex with degree \\(n-1\\) and one with degree \\(0\\) . Now the degree- \\(n-1\\) vertex is connected to all other vertices because the graph is simple, \\emph{including} the degree- \\(0\\) vertex. But the latter is not connected to any vertex, which is a contradiction. Therefore two vertices in the graph must have the same degree. [ 3 ] [ 7 ] 7.

Show that two graphs are isomorphic if and only if their complements are isomorphic. Answer: Let graph \\(G\\) be isomorphic to \\(H\\) , and let \\(\\overline G\\) , \\(\\overline H\\) denote their complements. Since \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(H\\) , then there exists a bijection \\(f: V(G) \\to V(H)\\) , such that \\((u, v) \\in E(G)\\) if and only if \\((f(u), f(v)) \\in E(H)\\) .

Let \\(G\\) be a graph having exactly two vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) of degree three and all other vertices have even degree. Then show that there is an \\(u, v\\) -path in \\(G\\) Answer: If \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are in the same component, then the proof is trivial. Assume that \\(u, v\\) are in two different components. Let, \\(u\\) belongs to the component \\(H\\) . Every other nodes \\(w \\in V(H)-u\\) have even degree. So, according to degree-sum theorem, \\[ 3 + \\sum_{w \\in V(H)-u} deg(w) = 2*|E(H)| \\] But the above equation cannot be true, since \\(3\\) is odd and sum of even degrees is even, which implies that the sum of an odd and even number cannot be even. Which means, \\(H\\) should have even number of odd degree nodes (The fact that \\(H\\) should have even number of odd-degree nodes directly follows from degree-sum theory ). Thus, our assumption of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) being in two different components is not true. \\(\\therefore\\) There is always a path between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) as they must belong to the same component 2. Write an algorithm to find a Eulerian circuit in an Eulerian graph based on the sufficiency proof of Lemma 3.2.1 Answer: BFS/DFS using edge coloring. Starting from any vertex \\(s\\) , take any unused/uncolored edge from \\(s\\) to go to a neighbour vertex \\(v\\) . Color \\((s,v)\\) so that this edge is not chosen again in the future. Append \\(s\\) , \\((s,v)\\) to the circuit. Recursively perform the algorithm until every edge is colored. 3. Give a proof of Lemma 3.2.2 Answer: A connected graph G is Eulerian if and only if G has a cycle decomposition. Proof: Let \\(G(V, E)\\) be a connected graph and let \\(G\\) be decomposed into cycles. If \\(k\\) of these cycles are incident at a particular vertex \\(v\\) , then \\(d(v) = 2k\\) . Therefore the degree of every vertex of \\(G\\) is even and hence \\(G\\) is Eulerian. Conversely, let \\(G\\) be Eulerian. We show \\(G\\) can be decomposed into cycles. To prove this, we use induction on the number of edges. Since \\(d(v)\\ge 2\\) for each \\(v \\in V\\) , \\(G\\) has a cycle \\(C\\) . Then \\(G-E(C)\\) is possibly a disconnected graph, each of whose components \\(C_1, C_2, ... C_k\\) is an even degree graph and hence Eulerian. By the induction hypothesis, each \\(C_i\\) is a disjoint union of cycles. These together with \\(C\\) provide a partition of \\(E(G)\\) into cycles. [ 1, p. 63 ] 4. Count the minimum number of edges required to add for making a non-Eulerian graph an Eulerian graph Answer: Considering the graph to be a simple connected graph, let \\(x =\\) Number of nodes with even degree and \\(y =\\) Number of nodes with odd degree. It follows from degree-sum theory that \\(y\\) is even. Pair every two vertexes with odd degree and add an edge between them. Every vertex now have even degree, ensuring an Eulerian graph.

Show that \\(K_n\\) has \\((n-1)/2\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. Answer: Since \\(K_n\\) is a complete graph, there exists an edge between any two vertex \\(v_i\\) and \\(v_j\\) for \\(i \\ne j\\) . Let \\(n = 2a+1\\) . We construct the following hamiltonian cycle taking every \\((v_i, v_{i+2})\\) : \\(v_1, v_3, v_5 ... v_{2a+1}, v_2, v_4 ... v_{2a}, v_1\\) \\(1, 3, 5, ... 2a+1, 2, 4, ... 2a, 1\\) Consider the integer sequence representing the cycle. This sequence will not have any repeated element (except \\(1\\) ) as difference between two element is even and total number of element is odd.
